# labXstack webdriverIO task

## Name
Testing Trello Website.

## Description
During the testing phase of the Trello website, I focused on evaluating various functionalities including user login, card creation, list creation, card and list deletion, and changing access from private to public. Utilizing WebdriverIO along with Mocha, Chai, Page Object Model (POM), and Spec Reporters, I structured my tests for efficient execution and clear reporting. The initial step involved writing test scenarios in Gherkin syntax to establish a comprehensive testing framework.

# How To Use:
These commands will initiate the test suite for the Trello website, allowing you to verify the functionality of user login, card creation, list creation, card and list deletion, and changing access from private to public.
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues during the testing process!
